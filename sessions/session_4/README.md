# Wine tasters
### Group: AAF
### Autors: Ángel Lapeña, Alba Quiñones, Frederico Simões
### Description:

This is the final project of the ml-intro-course-spring2025 from ICN2. In this work we aim to develop a Machine Learning tool, based in scikit-learn, to predict the score of the quality of the wine, given some physical-chemical properties. To do so, we used [this](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality) dataset to train the models. 

# Set up
Create a python or conda enviroment, activate it and install the dependencies by running

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# The project
In this repo you will find two main notebooks: `1_classification.ipynb` and `2_regression.ipynb`. You should follow that order when going through them, although each is self-contained.

The main purpose of this project is self-learning. We hope you enjoy it!
